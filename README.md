  <h1>A Domain-Specific Language for interpreting ARC-AGI abstracted images as code</h1>

  <p>The Erminia DSL is a collection of software tools and libraries designed to 
  facilitate the interpretation of ARC-AGI abstracted images as code. The primary
  motivation for creating this language is to provide a standardized way to represent
  ARC-AGI images, and allow researchers and developers wanting to participate in the 
  ARC-AGI challenge to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) on this representation, leveraging
  the inherent ability of LLMs to predict and generate code snippets,
  as opposed to interpreting images directly.
