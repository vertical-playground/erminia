## A Domain-Specific Language for interpreting ARC-AGI abstracted images as code

The Erminia DSL is a collection of software tools and libraries designed to facilitate the interpretation of ARC-AGI abstracted images as code. The primary motivation for creating this language is to provide a standardized way to represent ARC-AGI images, and allow researchers and developers wanting to participate in the ARC-AGI challenge to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) on this representation, leveraging the inherent ability of LLMs to predict and generate code snippets, as opposed to interpreting images directly.
